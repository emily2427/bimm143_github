Today we will take a step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principle components of some Halloween candy.

##Data Import

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"
```

```{r}
candy<- read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
dim(candy)
```
There are 85 different candy types in this dataset

> Q2.How many fruity candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```
There are 38 fruity candy types are in this dataset

## What is your favorite candy?

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Twix",] $winpercent
```
```{r}
candy["Rolo",] $winpercent
```
> Q4 What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",] $winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",] $winpercent
```
## We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful  for the first time you encounter a new dataset.

```{r}
library(skimr)
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The last column: `candy$winpercent`is on a different scale to all others.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

The zero in the candy$chocolate column mean that that candy is not chocolate and then a 1 indicated that it is a chocolate

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```
 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent)+
  geom_histogram(bins=10, color="blue", fill="skyblue")
```
 
> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate==1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
choc.win
```

```{r}
mean(choc.win)
```

```{r}
fruit.win<- candy[ as.logical(candy$fruity),]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```
This tells us that chocolate is more liked than candy. Where it says mean of x that value is referring to chocolate, and then the mean of y is referring to candy. From there, we can see that the mean of x is larger, indicating that chocolate is more liked.


```{r}
ans<- t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```

Yes with a P-value of `r ans$p.value`.

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

Yes it is  statistically significant

## 3. Overall Candy Rankings


There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`


```{r}
x<- c(5, 10, 1, 4)
sort( x)
```
```{r}
order(x)
```

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
inds<-order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```
These are the top five least liked candies

>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,],5)
```
The top 5 candies in this dataset is snickers, Kit Kat, Twix, Reese's miniatures, and Reese's peanut butter cup.


```{r}
inds<- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing=T)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```


> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy))+
  geom_col(fill="pink")
```


```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(x=winpercent, y=reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent), fill=chocolate)+
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want, with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a bar or not.


```{r}

mycols<- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "skyblue"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "#DAB1DA"
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy))+
  geom_col(fill=mycols)
```
> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
mycols<- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "skyblue"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "#DAB1DA"



ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, y=reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent))+
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=8)
```
The pink represent the fruity candy and then the sky blue represents the chocolate


![](mybarplot.png)

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst ranked chocolate candy is Sixlet

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked fruity candy is Nik L Nip

## 4. Winpercent vs Pricepercent

```{r}
mycols<- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "skyblue"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "#DAB1DA"


library(ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col= mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col= mycols, size=3.75, max.overlaps = 5)
```
> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

The top 5 most expensive candy types is Nik L Nip, Ring pop, Sugar Babies, Nestle Smarties, Pop rock

## 5. Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij<- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are negatively correlated

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```
The two in the code above gives us two decimal places if we ran it without the 2 we would get a value of -1

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "bar"], 2)
```



## Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all other in the data set

```{r}
pca<- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```
The first PCA captures 36% variance

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(pca$x)+
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x))+
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(col= mycols, size=3.75, max.overlaps = 5)+
  theme_bw()

```

The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loading" plot.

```{r}
pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes (PC1, rownames(pca$rotation))+
  geom_col()
```


```{r}
pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes (PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation),PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```
> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

The graph shows that fruity, pluribus, and hard are all positively correlated and the for the bars on the other side such as sugarpercent, nougat, etc are all negatively correlated
